#Way of working

Early on it was decided that each LIC became its own issue and was distributed between the group members. Sida took it upon himself to set up some base code to work from, Edvard constructed the build tool and Thea further developed the parameters that where used in testing and methods. Each pull request was reviewed by one other person. We said early on that we would set up a system so that one person always reviews the same persons pull requests - but due to how our working sessions developed, and our difference in knowledge when it came to git, this specific practice was not followed. We have agreed on how meetings should be done and when, and hopefully they will remain well structured in the future.

Perhaps an earlier agreement on some formalities could have been enforced, such as how commit messages should be formatted, who should be the leader of every meeting and what is expected of each other when it comes to the workload.

In summary, there are some principles and foundations established which are in use - but these could be further explored. There are things that could be further developed within the team, but we are on our way to develop a functioning working environment. Some of the kinks that became apparent when doing this assigment will be discussed and hopefully worked on when starting on the second assignment in order for us to work better together.
